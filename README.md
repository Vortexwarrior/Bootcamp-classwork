# Challenge 1

## My description 

Given the challenge i saw alot of div in the code that didnt need to be there was able to turn some to nav, section, and aside. looking though the page i notice the search engine was working and look that the others engine to see what it was missing to get it working again. I also added alt bar to give a breif discription of what each button says. for the css folder i saw alot of them did the same thing and renamed one and delete the others to make sure it look alot cleaner and still work the same.
